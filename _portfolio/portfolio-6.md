title: "UWB Software Library for FreeRTOS"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>I developed the Ultra-Wideband Software Library to provide out-of-the-box functionality for the Decawave (now Qorvo) DW1000 module when used with any embedded platform running FreeRTOS, such as the commercial drone Bitcraze Crazyflie. This library offers simple, one-line functions for performing pairwise ranging (i.e., distance measurements) and data transmission, incorporating acknowledgments to ensure no data is lost.
