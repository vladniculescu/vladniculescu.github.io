title: "Lightweight Collaborative SLAM for Robot Swarms"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>ano-C-SLAM - a multi-robot extension of NanoSLAM. This solution enables a swarm of tiny robots to perform
 collaborative mapping of an environment, relying on the UWB technology for communication and range-based collision avoidance. In this scenario, the computation related to graph-based optimization is distributed among all agents in the swarm, which contribute with their onboard resources to correct and align the maps acquired locally.
