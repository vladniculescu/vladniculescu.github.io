title: "Outdoor Localization of Sensor Nodes With Drones"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>This work focuses on sensor node localization in an outdoor environment. The goal is to achieve precise localization of deployed sensor nodes while minimizing their energy consumption. To accomplish this, the sensors utilize a Wake-up Radio (WUR) as an ultra-low-power always-on receiver, while Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is used for localization. The custom hardware integrates both UWB and WUR modules, along with an MCU responsible for computation.
