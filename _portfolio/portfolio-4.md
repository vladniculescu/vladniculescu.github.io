title: "UWB Localization of Sensor Nodes With Nano-Drones"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>Smart interaction between autonomous centimeter-scale drones and IoT sensor nodes is an upcoming
high-impact scenario. This work tackles precise 3D localization of unknown position edge nodes with an
autonomous drone that weighs 30 g. We employ a multilateration algorithm that runs onboard the
 drone and estimates the positions of the nodes relying on distance measurements acquired with UWB.
 However, UWB distance measurements are affected by multiple sources of errors, such as uneven
 radiation pattern of the antenna. We therefore propose a lightweight machine learning algorithm that
 models the UWB errors and allows to mitigate their effect. In addition, we propose a method to
 automatically train the model parameters onboard the drone.
