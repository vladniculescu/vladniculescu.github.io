title: "Vision-based Autonomous Navigation for Nano-Drones"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>This work enables vision-based autonomous navigation onboard a 30 g drone, exploiting a lightweight
CNN that works with greyscale images provided by the onboard camera. To achieve energy efficiency
and decrease the inference latency, the deep-learning model is quantized to 8-bit, with negligible
 accuracy loss with respect to the full precision model. This work explores methodologies and software
 tools to streamline and automate all the model deployment on a ULP multicore system-on-chip. Our
 navigation system can navigate both indoors and outdoors, follow corridors, steer in narrow pipes, and
 avoid static and dynamic obstacles when moving with a speed of up to 2 m/s.<br/><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41IwjAXmFQ0'><img src='/images/image3.jpg' width='600px'></a>"
