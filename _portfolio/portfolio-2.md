title: "Fully Onboard SLAM for Tiny Robots (NanoSLAM)"
excerpt: "<div style='max-width: 600px; text-align: justify; '>So far, SLAM was only feasible onboard robotic platforms that host power-hungry computing platforms,
 due to the required computational load and memory demands. Our work introduces NanoSLAM, a lightweight and optimized end-to-end SLAM engine specifically designed to operate on centimeter-size
 robots at a power budget of less than 100 mW. While conventional LiDARs are too heavy to operate onboard tiny robots, we fuse the information from four novel and miniaturized depth sensors.
 NanoSLAM is a graph-based approach that employs ICP scan-matching every time loop-closure is performed. The algorithm is developed in C, and runs entirelly onboard
 either on single core or leveraging the parallel capabilities of multicore RISC-V-based SoCs. <br/><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUSVLHJ87J0&t=205s'><img src='/images/image2.jpg' width='600px'></a>"
