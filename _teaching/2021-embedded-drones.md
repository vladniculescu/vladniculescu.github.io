The course lasts 14 weeks, with four-hour classes each week, and is offered every semester. Together with Tommaso Polonelli, I helped establish a new P&S class at ETH Zurich aimed at providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how drones work. The class begins with an introductory overview of the hardware components of drones and a preliminary tutorial on programming embedded systems. Subsequent sessions cover the theory behind state estimators and state controllers, complemented by hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts. The final seven weeks of the course are dedicated to a project, where teams of two students work on a project either proposed by us or suggested by the students. I have been teaching this class between March 2021 and June 2023.
