*"Chance favors the prepared mind."* --- Louis Pasteur

I have long believed that multidisciplinary knowledge is essential in engineering, offering a comprehensive understanding when working on complex projects.

I began my studies at Politehnica Bucharest, pursuing a BSc in Electrical Engineering with a focus on analog circuit design, computer architecture, and embedded systems. Eager to specialize more into algorithms, I pursued a master's degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zurich, where I shifted my focus to studying control systems and machine learning.

Then I embarked on a PhD journey under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Luca Benini in the Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich.
My research focused on enabling intelligence for resource-constrained robots, leveraging parallel and ultra-low-power computing platforms and sensor fusion algorithms. Working with nano-drones weighing about 30 g, I developed deep learning-based solutions for indoor autonomous navigation, range-based localization and enabled SLAM onboard any class of tiny robots. A significant challenge was the limited availability of suitable off-the-shelf hardware, leading to explore novel miniaturized sensors and develop custom hardware that fit the drones' requirements. 

Competitions have always been a great way for me to push myself and improve my teamwork skills. During my bachelors and master, I participated in several exciting student competitions like the Microsoft Imagine Cup and SpaceX Hyperloop Competition, where our team won second place and the Innovation Award. These experiences were a thrilling mix of innovation, teamwork, and learning, shaping my growth both personally and professionally.

Through my work, I've focused on advancing the capabilities of tiny robots, narrowing the gap with their larger counterparts. My PhD journey will conclude in July 2024, and I am excited for the next chapter ahead.
