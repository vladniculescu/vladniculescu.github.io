*"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk."*

<!-- A data-driven personal website

I have long believed that multidisciplinary knowledge is essential when working on complex engineering projects.

I began my studies at Politehnica Bucharest, pursuing a BSc in Electrical Engineering focusing on analog circuit design, computer architecture, and embedded systems. Eager to specialize more in algorithms, I pursued a master's degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zurich, where I shifted my focus to control systems and machine learning.

Then I embarked on a PhD journey under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Luca Benini in the Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich.
My research focused on enabling intelligence for resource-constrained robots, leveraging parallel and ultra-low-power computing platforms and sensor fusion algorithms. Working with nano-drones weighing about 30 g, I developed deep learning-based solutions for indoor autonomous navigation, range-based localization and enabled SLAM onboard tiny robots. A significant challenge was the limited availability of suitable off-the-shelf hardware, leading to exploring novel miniaturized sensors and developing custom hardware that fit the drones' requirements. 

Competitions have always been a great way for me to push myself and improve my teamwork skills. During my studies, I participated in several student competitions, such as the Microsoft Imagine Cup and the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition.
